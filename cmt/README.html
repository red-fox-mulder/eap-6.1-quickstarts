<p>Author: Tom Jenkinson
Level: Intermediate
Technologies: EJB, Container Managed Transactions (CMT)
Summary: EJB that demonstrates container-managed transactions (CMT)
Target Product: EAP</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">What is it?</h2>

<p>This quickstart demonstrates using transactions managed by the container. It is a fairly typical scenario of updating a database and sending a JMS message in the same transaction. A simple MDB is provided that prints out the message sent but this is not a transactional MDB and is purely provided for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>Aspects touched upon in the code:</p>

<ol>
<li>XA transaction control using the container managed transaction annotations</li>
<li>XA access to a PostgreSQL database using the JPA API</li>
<li>XA access to a JMS queue</li>
</ol>

<p>After users complete this quickstart, they are invited to run through the following quickstarts:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>jts</em> - The JTS quickstart builds upon this quickstart by distributing the CustomerManager and InvoiceManager</li>
<li><em>jts-distributed-crash-rec</em> - The crash recovery quickstart builds upon the <em>jts</em> quickstart by demonstrating the fault tolerance of JBossAS</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_2">What are container managed transactions?</h3>

<p>Prior to EJB, getting the right incantation to ensure sound transactional operation of the business logic was a highly specialised skill. Although this still holds true to a great extent, EJB has provided a series of improvements to to allow simplified transaction demarcation notation that is therefore easier to read and test. </p>

<p>With CMT, the EJB container sets the boundaries of a transaction. This differs from BMT (bean managed transactions) where the developer is responsible for initiating and completing a transaction via the methods begin, commit, rollback on a <code>javax.transaction.UserTransaction</code>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">What makes this an example of container managed transactions?</h3>

<p>Take a look at <code>org.jboss.as.quickstarts.cmt.ejb.CustomerManagerEJBImpl</code>. You can see that this stateless session bean has been marked up with the @javax.ejb.TransactionAttribute annotation.</p>

<p>The available options for this annotation are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Required - As demonstrated in the quickstart. If a transaction does not already exist, this will initiate a transaction and complete it for you, otherwise the business logic will be integrated into the existing transaction</li>
<li>RequiresNew - If there is already a transaction running, it will be suspended, the work performed within a new transaction which is completed at exit of the method and then the original transaction resumed. </li>
<li>Mandatory - If there is no transaction running, calling a business method with is annotated with this will result in an error</li>
<li>NotSupported - If there is a transaction running, it will be suspended and no transaction will be initiated for this business method</li>
<li>Supports - This will run the method within a transaction if a transaction exists, alternatively, if there is no transaction running the method will not be executed within the scope of a transaction </li>
<li>Never - If the client has a transaction running and does not suspend it but calls a method annotated with Never then an EJB exception will be raised.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4">System requirements</h2>

<p>All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven 3.0 or better.</p>

<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7. </p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Configure Maven</h2>

<p>If you have not yet done so, you must <a href="../README.html#mavenconfiguration">Configure Maven</a> before testing the quickstarts.</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Configure the application server to use PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>This quickstart requires the PostgreSQL database. Instructions to install an configure PostgreSQL can be found here: <a href="../README.html#postgresql">Install and Configure the PostgreSQL Database</a></p>

<p><em>Note</em>: For the purpose of this quickstart, replace the word QUICKSTART_DATABASENAME with <code>cmt-quickstart-database</code> in the PostgreSQL instructions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Be sure to start the PostgreSQL database. Unless you have set up the database to automatically start as a service, you must repeat the instructions &ldquo;Start the database server&rdquo; for your operating system every time you reboot your machine.</li>
<li><a href="../README.html#addpostgresqlmodule">Add the PostgreSQL Module</a> to the JBoss server <code>modules/</code> directory.</li>
<li><a href="../README.html#addpostgresqldriver">Add the PostgreSQL driver</a> to the JBoss server configuration file.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_7">Start JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7 with the Full Profile</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.</li>
<li><p>The following shows the command line to start the server with the full profile:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">For</span> <span class="n">Linux</span><span class="p">:</span>   <span class="n">JBOSS_HOME</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">standalone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="n">standalone</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">full</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">xml</span>
<span class="n">For</span> <span class="n">Windows</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">JBOSS_HOME</span><span class="o">\</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">\</span><span class="n">standalone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">bat</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="n">standalone</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">full</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">xml</span>
</pre>
</div></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_8">Build and Deploy the Quickstart</h2>

<p><em>NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See <a href="../README.html#buildanddeploy">Build and Deploy the Quickstarts</a> for complete instructions and additional options.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss Server with the PostgreSQL driver</li>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li><p>Type this command to build and deploy the archive:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">package</span> <span class="n">jboss</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">deploy</span>
</pre>
</div></li>
<li><p>This will deploy <code>target/jboss-as-cmt.war</code> to the running instance of the server.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_9">Access the application </h2>

<p>To access the application type the following into a browser: <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-cmt/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-cmt/</a></p>

<p>The application will be running at the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-cmt/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-cmt/</a>.</p>

<p>You will be presented with a simple form for adding customers to a database.</p>

<p>After a user is successfully added to the database, a message is produced containing the details of the user. An example MDB will dequeue this message and print the following contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Received</span> <span class="n">Message</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Created</span> <span class="n">invoice</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">customer</span> <span class="n">named</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">Tom</span>
</pre>
</div>

<h2 id="toc_10">Undeploy the Archive</h2>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li><p>When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">jboss</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">undeploy</span>
</pre>
</div></li>
