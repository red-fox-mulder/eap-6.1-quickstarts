Summary: Demonstrates how to use modules to control class loading for 3rd party logging frameworks
Target Product: EAP</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">What is it?</h2>

<p>This simple JSF 2.0 application shows how to use container defined modules to limit the size of the application package. It also shows how to use 
common versions of certain classes at runtime.</p>

<p>Applications must often depend on third-party libraries. By default, Java EE packages allow you to include dependencies in a deployable unit which can lead to uncontrolled growth of the deployable unit. This can be avoided by the use of container defined modules. A module is nothing more than a container managed binary dependency which is shared by all deployed applications. For more informatin on class loading and modules please refer to <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Class+Loading+in+AS7">Class Loading in AS7</a>.  </p>

<p>This example is very simple. It declares dependency on the Apache Log4j module which allows it to use a custom logging framework. This is achieved with a simple addition to the xml file: <code>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml</code>. For more information about this file please refer to <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Developer+Guide#DeveloperGuide-JBossDeploymentStructureFile">https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Developer+Guide#DeveloperGuide-JBossDeploymentStructureFile</a> or the product documentation.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">System requirements</h2>

<p>All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven 3.0 or better.</p>

<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7. </p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Configure Maven</h2>

<p>If you have not yet done so, you must <a href="../README.html#mavenconfiguration">Configure Maven</a> before testing the quickstarts.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Start JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7 with the Web Profile</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.</li>
<li><p>The following shows the command line to start the server with the web profile:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">For</span> <span class="n">Linux</span><span class="p">:</span>   <span class="n">JBOSS_HOME</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">standalone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span>
<span class="n">For</span> <span class="n">Windows</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">JBOSS_HOME</span><span class="o">\</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">\</span><span class="n">standalone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">bat</span>
</pre>
</div></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_5">Build and Deploy the Quickstart</h2>

<p><em>NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See <a href="../README.html#buildanddeploy">Build and Deploy the Quickstarts</a> for complete instructions and additional options.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li><p>Type this command to build and deploy the archive:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">package</span> <span class="n">jboss</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">deploy</span>
</pre>
</div></li>
<li><p>This will deploy <code>target/jboss-as-log4j.war</code> to the running instance of the server.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_6">Access the application </h2>

<p>The application will be running at the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-log4j/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-log4j/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Undeploy the Archive</h2>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li><p>When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">jboss</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">undeploy</span>
</pre>
</div></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_8">Run the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse</h2>

<p>You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see <a href="../README.html#useeclipse">Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts</a> </p>

<h2 id="toc_9">Debug the Application</h2>

<p>If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">dependency</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">sources</span>
    <span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">dependency</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">resolve</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Dclassifier</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">javadoc</span>
</pre>
</div>
</body></html>
