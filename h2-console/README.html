<p>Author: Pete Muir
Level: Beginner
Technologies: H2
Summary: Shows how to use the H2 console with JBoss AS
Target Product: EAP</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">What is it?</h2>

<p>JBoss AS bundles H2 as an in-memory, in-process database. H2 is written in Java so can run on any platform JBoss AS runs.</p>

<p>This is quickstart shows you how to use the H2 console with JBoss Enterprise Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7. It uses the <code>greeter</code> quickstart as a GUI for entering data.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">System requirements</h2>

<p>All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven 3.0 or better.</p>

<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7. </p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Configure Maven</h2>

<p>If you have not yet done so, you must <a href="../README.html#mavenconfiguration">Configure Maven</a> before testing the quickstarts.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This quickstart depends on the deployment of the &#39;greeter&#39; quickstart. Before running this quickstart, see the <a href="../greeter/README.html">greeter README</a> file for details on how to deploy it.</p>

<p>You can verify the deployment of the <code>greeter</code> quickstart by accessing the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-greeter">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-greeter</a> </p>

<p>Note: Unlike most of the quickstarts, this one requires JBoss AS 7.1.x or later.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Deploy the H2 Console</h2>

<p>This quickstart comes bundled with a version of the H2 Console built for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 and JBoss AS 7. The changes that have been made to the stock console are described below. </p>

<p>Deploy the console by copying the <code>QUICKSTART_HOME/h2-console/h2console.war</code> to the <code>$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments</code> directory. </p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Access the H2 Console </h2>

<p>You can access the console at the following URL:  <a href="http://localhost:8080/h2console">http://localhost:8080/h2console</a>.</p>

<p>You need to enter the JDBC URL, and credentials. To access the &ldquo;test&rdquo; database that the <code>greeter</code> quickstart uses, enter these details:</p>

<ul>
<li>JDBC URL: <code>jdbc:h2:mem:greeter-quickstart;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1</code></li>
<li>User Name: <code>sa</code></li>
<li>Password: <code>sa</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Click on the <em>Test Connection</em> button to make sure you can connect. If you can, go ahead and click <em>Connect</em>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">Investigate the H2 Console</h2>

<p>Take a look at the data added by the <code>greeter</code> application. Run the following SQL command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="n">select</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">from</span> <span class="n">users</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>You should see the two users seeded by the <code>greeter</code> quickstart, plus any users you added when testing that application.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Changes to the H2 Console for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 and JBoss AS 7</h2>

<p>To make the H2 console run on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 and JBoss AS 7, the H2 libraries were removed from the WAR and a dependency on the H2 module was added to the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF fle. The rebuilt console is provided with this quickstart.</p>
